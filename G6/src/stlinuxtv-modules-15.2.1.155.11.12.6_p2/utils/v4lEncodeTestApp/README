v4l Encode Test Application README

(1) How to compile
Edit the Makefile and comment/uncomment lines depending on which environment you are using.
Then type 'make all' and 'make install'

(2) How to run
On the target after kernel is booted, enter the following commands to insert the generic modules and the encoder driver module:
./framework_go.sh
modprobe h264enchw

You can then start an encoding test with the following command:
For Video Encode:
	/root/v4lEncodeTestApp <configuration file> <yuv input file> <h264 encoded bitstream>
	example of configuration file: VBR1.Monaco_II_1024x576.ini
For Video Audio:
	/root/v4lEncodeTestApp <configuration file> <pcm input file> <AC3 encoded bitstream>
	example of configuration file: ac3.ini

(3) Run multiple encode applications at the same time
Steps to launch many encode clients at the same time:
  - use DirectFB libraries compiled with "multi applications" flag (default in SDK2 is "single application"). DirectFB RPM packages can be found at http://havana.bri.st.com/release/stlinux24/internal.
  - open as many terminals as encode clients and launch the application in each terminal but be sure to set a different queue index parameter for each; the command for multi-client is as follows:
/root/v4lEncodeTestApp <configuration file> <yuv input file> <h264 encoded bitstream> <input queue index (default=0)>
