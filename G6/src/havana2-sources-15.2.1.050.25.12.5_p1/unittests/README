Build and test with:
  $ make -j4 check

Build and test more extensive tests with:
  $ make -j4 check-full

The unitary tests currently cover:
- os abstraction layer: os_unittests
- stream engine: se_unittests

The unitary tests execute on the host workstation.

Concerning the se_unittests testsuite,

To run:
recommanded way is through make targets.

For specific testcase debugging you can also use following cmds:
    ./se_unittests --gmock_verbose=error => will run all tests
    ./se_unittests --help => display available options
    ./se_unittests --gtest_list_tests => lists all available tests
    ./se_unittests --gtest_filter=<regexp>  => run only the tests whose name match <regexp>

    To change streaming engine activated trace groups or trace level, you must set environment variables SE_TRACE_GROUPS / SE_TRACE_LEVEL:
    SE_TRACE_GROUPS=3,-1,-1,.. SE_TRACE_LEVEL=5 ./se_unittests 


The unitary tests execute on the host workstation.
Only the parts of streaming engine that have some tests and their dependencies are built.

To add new unitary tests:
    - create a directory where to store the tests for the object you want to test an 
      put your new unitary tests there
    - in the Makefile, add the new directory to the VPATH variable and add the list of test files to the
      UNITTEST_OBJECTS variable 
    - in the Makefile, add the missing files of the streaming engine that you want to compile to 
      STREAMING_CPPOBJECTS /STREAMING_COBJECTS variables. If needed, also add missing directories to VPATH
