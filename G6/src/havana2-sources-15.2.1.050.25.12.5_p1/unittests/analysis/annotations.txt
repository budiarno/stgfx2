# This file defines the list of code analysis defects that should be
# considered OK (i.e. not a defect).
#
# TODO: simplify the format, rationalise the generic classes
# as analysis tools are added.
#
# The format is:
# - empty lines or lines tarting with '#' are ignored
# - each line represent a defect to be ignored and must be written:
# OK:<class>:<file>:<line_num>:<comment>:<line_content>
# where:
# OK             : mandatory
# <class>        : class of the defect, one of
#           - ALL (any issue is ignored)
#           - DEAD_CODE
#           - UNTESTED
#           - USELESS_WRITE
#           - DEACTIVATED_CODE
#           - SIGN_CHANGE
#           - ASSERT
# <file>         : file path relative to the root dir
# <line_num>     : line num in the <file>
# <comment>      : any comment (must not contain a colon ':')
# <line_content> : any content identifying the line
#                  (matched at word boundary as per "fgrep -w")
#
# For instance a valid line looks like:
# OK:DEAD_CODE:src/path/binding.c:128:Dead code in macro:CIRCLEQ_FOREACH_
#
