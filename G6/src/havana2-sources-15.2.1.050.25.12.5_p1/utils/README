======================== Streaming Engine utilities ===========================

Streaming Engine utilities is a set of scripts whose goal is to better :
- Understand
- Monitor
- Analyze
streaming engine activities, especially when it comes to handle large traces
Most of those utilities use parseNplot (and GNUPlot, its graph backend) to
generate a data visualization fitted for specific purposes

===============================================================================

# Requirements :
    - parseNplot.pl in PATH
    - parseNplot in its very latest version
    - gnuplot installed

# Note : details on each script (--help is available for most of them)

------------------------------- se-pipeline.pl --------------------------------
    - Goal
        Monitoring Streaming Engine pipeline and AVSync
        It represents, for each frame, the date it came through selected stages
        of the processing pipeline
    - Data source :
        Live feed using a ssh connection to a running target
        It first connects to a target, activates necessary traces and launches
        parseNplot to display a live monitoring window
        (--tv display it on target main display)
        (--help for details)

------------------------------ devlog-bitrate.sh ------------------------------
    - Goal :
        Visualization of the bitrates of write operations on video and audio
        devices
    - Data source :
        Devlog file of a usecase
