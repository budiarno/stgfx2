Streaming Engine sources: multimedia playback and encode engine,
with hw acceleration, avsync, trickmodes, ..

######StreamingEngine is made up of the following linux kernel modules:
###feature modules
-'player2'      (streaming engine platform sw device driver 'stm-se')
                    [EXPORT_SYMBOLs: stm_se_X]
-'osdev_abs'    (abstraction functions to use the char SE devices from player2)
                    [EXPORT_SYMBOLs: OSDEV_DeviceList, OSDEV_DeviceDescriptors, OSDEV_Open/_Ioctl/_Close]
-'stmalloc'     (memory allocator char device driver)
                    [char dev - manual MAJOR:245]
-'sth264pp'     (h264_preprocessor platform device driver 'h264pp')
                    [also exposes char dev - manual MAJOR:246]
-'sthevcpp'     (hevc_preprocessor platform device driver 'hevcpp')
                    [also exposes char dev - manual MAJOR:247]
-'hades'        (hevc_hard_host_transformer platform device driver 'hades')
                    [also exposes char dev (tbc)]
-'vp8hw'        (vp8_hard_host_transformer platform device driver 'vp8')
-'h264enchw'    (h264_encode_hard_host_transformer platform device driver 'h264encoder')
-'ksound'       (ALSA core wrapper functions)
                    [EXPORT_SYMBOLs: ksnd_pcm_X, ksnd_ctl_X, ksnd_hctl_X, ksnd_substream_X]
###shared relayfs based tracing modules: (active if CONFIG_RELAY and CONFIG_DEBUG_FS set)
-'strelayfs'    (strelay client functions)
                    [EXPORT_SYMBOLs: st_relayfs_X]
-'strelaycore'  (strelay core functionsset)
                    [EXPORT_SYMBOLs: st_relaycore_X]
###internal utility modules:
-'mmelog'       (MME logging utility functions)
                    [EXPORT_SYMBOLs: acc_MME_X]
-'mmestub'      (MME userspace char device driver)
                    [char dev]
###internal test modules: (active if CONFIG_DEBUG_FS set)
-'ktone'            (ktones generation (on spawned thread) test module for ksound)
-'encoderstkpi'     (encoder stkpi standalone test module)
-'encoderdbgfs'     (encoder debugfs test module)
-'KTM_ControlData'  (collator test module)
