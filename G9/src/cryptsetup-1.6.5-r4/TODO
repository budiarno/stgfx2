Version 1.7:
- Export wipe device functions
- Support K/M suffixes for align payload (new switch?).
- TRIM for keyslots
- Do we need crypt_data_path() - path to data device (if differs)?
- Resync ETA time is not accurate, calculate it better (last minute window?).
- crypto backend should initialise itself only once (debug log)
- Extend existing LUKS header to use another KDF? (https://password-hashing.net/)
- Fix all crazy automake warnings (or switch to Cmake).
