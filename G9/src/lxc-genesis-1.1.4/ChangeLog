- Improve configuration file parser and add test suite.

	Now all graphical characters, as determined by isgraph(), can be part of an
	environment variable name except '='. They can also be part of an
	environment variable value, including '='. Note that space characters are
	still not allowed.

	We ensure a statement cannot span multiple lines. Previously, the
	following content was valid and interpreted as expected:

			user=my_user group=my_group

	Prefix all lex/yacc to avoid symbol name conflicts with packages also using
	lex/yacc without a prefix.

	Separate the configuration file parser from the core logic in order to
	easily test it. Add a test framework and a test suite for the parser.

	Clean up the parser by removing duplicated lex/yacc variable/function
	declarations, and moving code to the right place.

	Add the --enable-config-debug option to easily turn on lexer/parser debug
	traces.

	Add a Doxygen configuration file.
