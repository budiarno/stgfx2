lxc_genesis component provides two static libraries
    * liblxc_genesis_core.a which contains all core functions
      especially function ``lxc_genesis_setup``.
    * liblxc_genesis.a which contains a "constructor" function which
      use fonction ``lxc_genesis_setup`` to setup the process
      environment. This "constructor" function is called before the
      process main function.

lxc_genesis use the "/lxc_genesis.conf" file to get the configuration.
The syntax is the following :
    * user=[username] : this is used to change the process uid
    * group=[groupname] : this is used to change the process gid
    * umask=[umaskval] : this is used to set the process usmask
    * rlimit=[RESSOURCE]|[current value]|[max_value] : set ressource limits for
    the process
    * [environment variable]=[values] : this environment variable is set for the
    process

The libraries can be linked using pkg-config tool
    * lxc_genesis_core.pc file for liblxc_genesis_core.a.
    * lxc_genesis.pc file for liblxc_genesis.a.
Otherwise when linking to the library with "constructor" you need to add this compilation option :
    * -u lxc_genesis_setup_constructor
This will force the compilator to add this symbol from the static library.

If --enable-hardened configure option is set, lxc_genesis is disabling ptrace and
core dumping capability.

If --enable-hardened configure option is set, GENESIS_CONFIG_FILE environment
variable can be used to override default config file location.
If GENESIS_CONFIG_FILE is not set and if /lxc_genesis.conf is not found,
lxc_genesis is running the process as root:root with the default config.

Using lxc_genesis init script is DEPRECATED.
