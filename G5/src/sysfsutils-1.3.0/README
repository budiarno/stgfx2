1. Introduction
---------------

This package's purpose is to provide a set of utilities for interfacing
with sysfs, a virtual filesystem in Linux kernel versions 2.5+ that
provides a tree of system devices. While a filesystem is a very useful
interface, we've decided to provide a stable programming interface
that will hopefully make it easier for applications to query system devices
and their attributes.

This package currently includes:

- libsysfs: a library for accessing system devices.
- systool: an application to view system device information by bus, class,
	and topology.
- A number of example usage routines in the "test" directory.
- A comprehensive testsuite, also shipped as part of the "test" directory. This
	testsuite can be used to test _all_ the APIs exported by Libsysfs. 
	Please refer the libsysfs.txt file in the "docs" directory for 
	details as to how to use the testsuite.


2. How to Install
-----------------

Run the "configure" script to generate Makefiles. Use "make" to build the
library and utilities. 

For a successful install, run "make install" as super-user. "make uninstall"
will clean up all installed files.


2.1 Caveats/Known issues
------------------------

The header files (libsysfs.h and dlist.h) are installed in /usr/include/sysfs
by default. This _cannot_ be changed by using the --prefix or --includedir 
parameters while running the "configure" script. 

As a consequence, when a non-root user runs the "configure" script with these
options and builds the package, and tries to install it, "make install" will
return an error since the non-root user will not have "write" permission to 
/usr/include/sysfs to install the headers. 

The default install location for the library and utilities (under test/ and
cmd/) is /usr/local/lib/ and /usr/local/bin/ respectively. Please use the 
--libdir and --bindir parameters during configure time to change this as 
needed.

The header files will have to be manually copied over by the user to the 
desired directory.
